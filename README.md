# Applied-and-Computational-Statistics
This repository contains 4 statistical mini-projects. All code has been written in R. Each folder contatins the R code for the project, a data file and a report describing the analysis that I performed and my conclusions. 


#### Project 1. Choosing the most suitable linear model for the “swim” data collected by students at the Queensland University of Technology. 

The goal of this project is to determine the factors affecting the time to swim one lap of a 25m pool. Following factors were measured during the experiment: lap number, presence of goggles, presence of a shirt, presence of flippers, and the end at which the lap started. Students recorder 24 laps in experimental conditions.


#### Project 2. Choosing the most suitable general linear model for the “apple” data concerned with the growth of Alicyclobacillus Acidoterrestris CRA7152 in Apple Juice.

The goal of this report is to determine factors affecting the presence of CRA7152 growth. Following factors were measured during the experiment: pH level, Brix level (sugar content), the temperature of the juice and Nisin level (food preservative), 74 data samples were obtained.


#### Project 3. Testing for a difference in distributions in two datasets, ”home” and ”clotting”, both concerned with blood testing.

The goal of the first part of this report is to determine if the blood pressure measurements taken at home by the patient and the measurements taken in a hospital by a nurse have the same distribution. The goal of the second part of the report is to compare blood clotting times while taking different treatments in order to verify if there is a reduction in clotting time when taking the new treatment.

#### Project 4. Using bootstrap estimators to analyse two datasets, "Earthquakes" and "Service".

The dataset contains information about the amount of time (in days) that passed between the consecutive Earthquakes (of Magnitude higher than 6) between 1970 and 2009, while the second dataset provides the service time (in minutes) for 174 customers at a college snack bar. Both datasets are available in the R library 'resampledata'.
