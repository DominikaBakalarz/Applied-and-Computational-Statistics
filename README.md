# Applied-and-Computational-Statistics
This repository contains 4 statistical mini-projects. All code has been written in R.


#### Project 1. Choosing the right linear model for the “swim” data collected by students at the Queensland University of Technology. 

The goal of this project is to determine the factors affecting the time to swim one lap of a 25m pool. Following factors were measured during the experiment: lap number, presence of goggles, presence of a shirt, presence of flippers, and the end at which the lap started. Students recorder 24 laps in experimental conditions.

File 'swim.txt' contains the original data, 'Linear model code. R' contains all my code, and 'Linear Model.pdf' contains the report.
